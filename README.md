# sixs_json
This repository contains the modified 6S Fortran code to output json files and a Python wrapper to run the code and read the output.

It is intended to be used to generate look up tables or integrated in other software and is optimized for speed.

# Instalation

This software can be installed from this repository with the `build.sh` script on unix and `bld.bat` on windows.

It will be available from the conda-forge channel soon.

A Python wrapper was developed by Robin Wilson and is available at: https://github.com/robintw/Py6S
IÂ´ve reused some of his code to compile 6s in a platform independent way and build on conda-forge (https://github.com/conda-forge/sixs-feedstock).
